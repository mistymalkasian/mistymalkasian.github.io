<h2>The Tales o&apos; Aggonye:<br>
The wretched chronicle of the pitiable denizens who lived in an enchanted village long past.
</h2>

<p>
I. He's Diggin' It.<br>
There once was a young man (we shall call him Leland), who had no life calling. One day, Leland was walking along, when an urgency in the spirit overtook him. A bright light from the heavens ascended, and spoke comforting words to Leland’s soul. Suddenly, Leland knew what his life calling was.<br>
“My life calling is to be a ditch digger,” he screeched to anyone that would listen. As the years progressed, Leland grew more and more involved with his work.<br> 
“I will dig a ditch to the very center of the universe!” poor Leland proclaimed. Unfortunately, there was a slight flaw in Leland’s plan. He didn’t have a shovel, and he was standing on carpet. Leland’s uncle (we shall call him Richard) heard his proclamation and tried pointing this unfortunate fact out to young Leland.<br> 
“It matters not!” ill-fated Leland declared. “I will dig a ditch!” and with that, hapless young Leland went to work. He dug for days with an invisible shovel, scooping up shovelful after horrifying shovelful of invisible dirt. The longer he dug, the bigger his invisible ditch grew, until his invisible ditch was dug almost to the invisible core of the earth.<br> 
“My ditch is almost done.” Leland stated as he wiped invisible sweat from his brow. “Now I shall-“<br> 
But we shall never know what reckless Leland would have said, because he suddenly inclined forward, and fell all the way down into his invisible hole.<br> 
“I have fallen!” naïve Leland shouted. “Whatever am I to do?”<br>  
Richard, who was in the carpeted room opposite the adolescent lad, brushing his beard, heard his anxious screams and came to see what the trouble was.<br> 
“Uncle Richard,” Leland screamed. “Please help me from this ditch!”<br> 
“What ditch?” guarded Richard replied.<br>  
“The ditch I am at the bottom of, even as we speak!” The young man wailed.<br> 
“Lee,” Richard sighed, “There is no ditch. It’s invisible.”<br> 
But foolish Leland would not hear reason, and was content to rot the rest of his days at the bottom of that solitary, invisible ditch. His only food was the moldy, stale bread Richard threw down to his prison and his only water in rusty, corroded canteens.<br> <br> 

<h5>Moral: Don’t dig invisible ditches.</h5>

<p>II. An Unfortunate Marriage.<br>
“His nose is too big, Papa,” she’d say as an excuse, or “His feet stink.”<br>
Her father, of course, would drag them off, and tell them to find some other way to be saved, and would usher the newest caller in to his daughter with nervous anticipation.<br>
While Mia enjoyed all this sudden attention, there was one thing she wanted that she still didn’t have.<br>
Panar.<br>
So, she decided to win him over.<br>
She searched high and low, but she could never seem to find him. Finally, on her way home, she saw him on the edge of town, on one knee, holding out a single, long stemmed rose to the beautiful Bedicia.<br>
“Wait, Panar,” she cried, making the ground shake as she ran. “Forget Bedicia, she’s nothing but a commoner. Be saved, and marry me!”<br>
But Panar, lost in the love of youth, only stared into Bedicia’s flame-blue eyes and sighed. “My love, if I should ever die, I would it would be by your side.”<br>
In a rage that he had just brushed her off, Mia pounced upon them both.<br>
“So let it be written, so let it be done!” she howled.<br>
Then she swallowed them both whole.<br><br>

<h5>Moral: True love is only what you perceive it to be.</h5>

<h2>Bad Beginnings: an Easter Tale</h2>
<p>

  Allisssiah looked around frantically. There was no time for thinking—just action. The terrifying thing was closing in on her quickly, and soon she would be reduced to a crispy critter.
  <br>
 It was spewing fire, and with eyes of flame, came whiffling through the lonely wood, and burbled as it came!<br>
“Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!” she called as she dove for the nearest bush.<br>
“There is no help for you!” the thing roared, raising its terrifying head and breathing its rancid breath into the air, knocking out several unfortunate birds. It let out a horrible sounding laugh, and came toward her with rage and torture burning in its eyes…<br><br>

Allisssiah sat up, breathing hard and looking wildly around the room. Slowly she relaxed as it dawned on her that it was only a dream—a terrible, horrible dream.<br>
“Thank heaven,” she sighed.<br>
She rubbed her arms to ward off the chill, then looked out of the dim window. The sky was dark, gray, and stormy, a mere omen of what was to come.<br>
She stepped out of bed and her foot hit the FREEZING COLD floor.<br>
“AUGHHHH!!!” she screamed in agony as she raced across the concrete floor and to the safety of the hallway carpet.<br>
Allisssiah went downstairs, hoping that her dear old mum had something special in mind for today’s Easter celebrations.<br>
“Where’s my breakfast, Mum?” she asked, seeing that everyone in the house was already eating.<br>
Her dear old mum waved her hand, as if in dismissal. “Floating in the ether,” she replied, taking a huge bite out of her delectable-looking, golden, piping hot chocolate chip pancakes.<br>
Allisssiah sighed and opened the refrigerator. Looking around in it, she saw that her only choices were:<br><br>

</p>

<ol>

<li>A single stalk of wilted asparagus</li>
<li>Half a boiled egg, wrapped in aluminum foil for some odd reason</li>
<li>Several mini tubs of buttermilk ranch</li>
<li>A suspicious-looking bag of cheese cubes left over from thanksgiving (of last year)</li>

</ol>
<br>
<p>
She gave up on breakfast and went back to her room to get dressed. Tearing apart her closet, she began to realize with dawning horror that the only clothes she had were from a special store that she liked to call ‘Junkyard Granny’.<br>
 “Noooo,” she moaned miserably, and, pulling a random shirt out of her closet, threw it on. She then tried to yank a brush through her unruly hair with little success.
“Moan,” she moaned.<br>  
Already this Easter wasn’t looking like it was going to turn out to be the greatest one yet. The End.<br><br>

<h5>Moral:Bad days happen to the best of us. The important thing is how you handle them... which this story does not teach you how to do, so you're on your own.</h5>
