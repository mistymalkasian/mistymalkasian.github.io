<h2>Fred's Folly</h2>
<p>"Two plus two is what, Fred?" the teacher asked with glee.<br>
(For weeks now she'd been telling the class that two plus two was three.)<br>
Poor Fred stammered with a vengeance, he tried to calm his knocking knees;<br>
But the harder he tried to calm his nerves, the more he seemed to freeze.<br>
The teacher gave him a look of hatred, filled with putrid spite;<br>
She patronized the poor young lad, for she loved to see his fright.<br>
"Fred, you know what your punishment will be!"<br>
She said, delighting his cold misery to see.<br>
Fred did know what his punishment was, but he would not die with shame.<br>
"I will not tell you, teacher, for your false words are made to maim!"<br>
She pounced upon the student, ignoring his screams of pain, and sank her teeth into him (you could almost smell his dread).<br>
Many have died at her bloody hands, but none so brave as Fred.

<h2>To the King, on the Throne</h2>
<p>To the king, who sitteth on the throne:<br>
I actually feel sorry for you.<br>
Some may say they'd like to be king<br>
But they wouldn't if they were you.<br>
His choices weigh him nightly down<br>
His exertions force a dismal frown<br>
He thinks, "Why? Why me? WHY AM I KING?!"<br>
He pushes himself to the highest<br>
Only to fail.<br>
He boredly drums on his royal ring.<br>
O, what horrid fate 'twould be<br>
To daily sit on that throne<br>
And let out a groan<br>
And wheeze out a moan<br>
And have to see what you don't want to see.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>The P. Man</h2>
<p>move fast and cunning away, away from those four, sharp teeth<br>
to cold THE P MAN RISES<br>
he is super-human. Or not human. Or creature. Squeaking, biting, scratching, clawing<br>
P Man? is that scary, four toothed thing. That monster behind the mask. The cuteness hiding the talons and claws hissing, burring, multi-colored man<br><br>

if the P man crawls up here<br><br>

<i>somebody An orange man</i><br>
wanting you.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>The Ponderings of Man</h2>
<p>Slowly, quietly Towards the light<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">May find Wakefulness to drink Dark and cloudy, slashing lightning, and pouring rain My nightmare</p><br>
<p>the black sky Twisting<br>
Hope? is Bright and beckoning Splashing, wanting to play<br><br>

I would find it by following the light, awake from my nightmares if I'm followed by a zombie<br><br>

<i>somebody A menacing, laughing clown</i><br>
trying to invade you.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>The P. Man Returns</h2>
<p>to It was a dark and stormy night<br><br> 

is when P man came again. Came with four sharp paws a-raised, looking to devour men. But there was one, who would not break, no matter how hard he tried. So he sat on her lap, and let it all out. And she screamed until she died.<br><br> 

if<br><br>

<i>somebody P Man!</i><br>
A filthy animal you.

</p>
<br><br>



<h2>Toothache</h2>
<p>Hold my mouth, trying not to let my teeth fall out To the left, to the left<br>
want new teeth. That is The bathroom, using a toothbrush to aquire Sad Cold winter morning<br>
A 'FLOSS MORE!' sign Freezing my oral cavities<br>
The dentist is Water rushing over sparkling white<br><br>

Go back and brush more if He makes me bleed<br><br>

<i>somebody Someone with dentures</i><br>
The future you.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Lost Amid the Surf</h2>
<p>Walking on the shore of life,<br> 
Through the rains and mist,<br>
I think about time gone by<br>
And sorrows that no longer exist.<br>
What is the point of feeling pain<br>
If it will all be swept away?<br>
My footprints disappear in the rain,<br>
Memories are washed by the ocean spray.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Constipation</h2>
<p>My stomach churns<br>
And in my heart I know<br>
I can't, I'm constipated<br>
But I GOTTA GO!<br>
Wheezin' and squeezin'<br>
Pushin' it out<br>
I stand upon the throne<br>
And let out a shout<br>
My face is burnin'<br>
From sheer hard work<br>
I can't shove it out<br>
I...can't...shove...it...out...<br>
And then, I realize<br>
My attempts are in vain<br>
This is God's plan<br>
So I'll just deal with this pain.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Time to Make a Run for It</h2>
<p>Quietly To a new world<br>
search for Somewhere, anywhere to somewhere where life goes on Endless day tock tock<br>
tick tick spinning out of sight<br>
nothing, or everything is shrinking, swirling running out of time<br><br>

I would slow down if time should end<br><br>

<i>Somebody The lord of time</i><br>
Coming for you.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Untitled (or title lost over the years)</h2>
<p>I remember when you were younger<br>
You sat beside me on the floor<br>
Laughing, and having fun<br>
Just because you could.<br>
I remember telling you to always stay this way<br>
Because life isn't as fun<br>
When you try to change:<br>
Oh, darling. Keep playing with<br>
My kittens on the floor!<br>
Keep quilting, and sewing, and eating all the mooooore!<br>
Who cares if we're fat?<br>
We can get huger than that!<br>
We... will... EXPAND!<br>
Oh, darrrrling!<br> 
We will rule the world!

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Untitled</h2>
<p>Nearly through<br> 
With twilight<br>
Getting ever close<br>
To midnight<br>
Waiting underneath<br> 
The stars.<br>
Ever-beating<br>
Hasting heart.<br>
Staring up,<br>
Above my head<br>
Can't focus,<br>
Thinking of you instead.<br>
Missing you<br>
With all I have<br>
Memories like a<br>
Burning salve.<br>
Eyes dark<br>
In misty glow<br>
Clock still ticking-<br>
Where did you go?<br>
Wait, and wait<br>
You're still not here<br>
Fate is fate.<br>
Goodbye, my dear.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Thievery</h2>
<p>hide out to my own home!<br>
to the same kind<br> 
my worldy treasures nagging at me, taking from me<br>
is for a time I thought there was a thief among us. I thought I'd track him down,<br>
but prior to my pursuit,<br>
the smoke had cleared, and to my disbelief<br>
there was no theif cuz it was Rich that lost it<br><br>

Steal those lyrics, like he steals it all from us if everything gets taken<br><br> 

<i>somebody a thief, Rich</i><br>
after you. 

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>The Lion</h2>
<p>Run! Run for your life! Away! Away!<br>
Narnia, minus the breath to HEEELP!!! mythical<br> 
his mouth SMELLS YOUR BREATH<br>
you smell his. is you can run, but you can't hide from the lion.<br><br>

if ohhhhhhh, CHILDREN!!!<br><br>

somebody the lion?!?<br>
staring at you.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>The Grip of High Power</h2>
<p>away from the power, the violence. to the saving of myself. My heart, mind and soul.<br>
alone and quiet, with time to think to gloomy and depressed the heart of endless winter<br>
the stormy, darkened sky chilling every bone<br>
secret meeting, deciding then my fate is rushing, invading washing away the pain<br><br>

if I suddenly pass<br><br>

somebody a brooding stranger<br>
against you. so against you.

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Tight Pants is Swimmin'</h2>
<p>Up to his ears in bitter tears<br>
He can’t believe he’s sunk this low<br>
As he teeters on the hotel’s fish tank’s inner sanctum<br>
Got outta the church service<br>
Waved to Kree in a bon-less bon voyage<br>
Kree said she’s goin’ North then headed South<br>
But ‘afore she left she stuffed him into a waiting turtle’s mouth<br>
Tight pants is swimmin’ with fishes here,<br>
At the Renaissance Hotel.<br>
Tight pants is WAAAAAY too nutritious here,<br>
At the Renaissance Hotel.<br>
Tight pants loves Kriggie here,<br>
He don’t want Brother Paul to give him a belly ache…how long is this gonna take?<br>
He woke up this morning kinda blue, thinking through that age ol’ question<br>
How to get out of the turtle’s digestion<br>
It might behoove him to be heaved<br> 
Head out like a human tight pants ball<br>
Hmmm… wonder  what rhymes with tight pants ball?<br>
Tight pants is swimmin’ with fishes here,<br>
At the Renaissance Hotel.<br>
Tight pants is WAAAAAY too nutritious here,<br>
At the Renaissance Hotel.<br>
Tight pants loves Kriggie here,<br>
He doesn’t want Brother Paul to give him a belly ache…how long is this gonna take?<br>
Those pants they’re just’a coming to town<br>
Those pants are starting to break Kriggle down to the core<br>
Good Lord! Krig might give him a second chance!<br>
He’s one of the fishes here<br>
In the fish pond at the Renaissance hotel<br>
The turtles think he’s delicious here<br>	
In the fish pond at the Renaissance hotel<br>
In the belly of the turtle (repeat 6x)<br>
In the belly o’ the turtle<br>
His pants are underneath another’s tail

</p>

<h2>Pushin' Till I Cry: Parody of "Alligator Sky"</h2>
<p>Chorus<br>
Where was I<br>
When the blockage came to life?<br>
I was feelin’odd today<br>
Now I’m pushin’ till I cry.<br>
Even though<br>
I am feelin’pretty low<br>
I’ve really gotta go. I’ve really gotta go.<br><br>

Verse<br> 
Remember to breathe<br> 
Cuz it’ll take your breath away<br>
When you feel the breeze<br> 
And you start to wheeze<br>
When you’re in there, perched upon that throne.<br>
Remember to live<br>
Cuz you’re gonna wish for death<br>
When your insides collide, and eyes grow wide<br>
When you realize you are all alone.<br>
Remember to scream, and give it all you got<br>
Because otherwise, it just might not.<br>
So harmonize with the screeching eagle’s flight.<br>
Remember to heave, cuz you’re gonna wanna get it out<br>
When the constipation erupts, and it lights you up.<br>
Scrape your toes on the throne room floor<br> 
Cuz you’re in for a long, long night.
